Source repository for the Hwacha vector-thread co-processor.

To use this coprocessor, include this repo as a git submodule and add it as 
to your chip's build.scala as a Project, e.g.
lazy val hwacha = Project("hwacha", file("hwacha"), settings = buildSettings)

Hwacha depends on the Chisel and HardFloat projects, make sure these libraries' 
jars are installed.
